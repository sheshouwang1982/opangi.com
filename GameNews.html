            <h2>World of Warcraft 2024 Limited-Time Events Currency Buffs</h2>
            <div class="date">Published on November 24, 2024</div>
            <p>World of Warcraft recently revealed that many of its 2024 limited-time events are getting currency gain buffs in the later stages because it's easier to increase those numbers than to reduce them. While this may frustrate players who want to complete events as quickly as possible, WoW prefers to err on the side of caution because it can't reduce those numbers without causing a backlash from the community.</p>
            <p>This year, WoW has hosted multiple limited-time events: Plunder Storm, World of Warcraft Reforged, Mists of Pandaria, Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, the War Within "Radiant Echoes" pre-patch event, and the ongoing 20th Anniversary Celebration. Despite their differences, each of these WoW events had its currency collection rates adjusted at some point during the event.</p>
            <p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar+, WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas explained why this keeps happening. "We can adjust the rewards at any time," he said. "We would never nerf rewards, really, right? If they were given out too quickly and too generously, we wouldn't take them back. So while we're playing a little bit of a guessing game trying to pick the right values, we might be tempted to err on the conservative side." Hazzikostas stressed that the developers weren't deliberately being stingy, but were trying to strike a balance between rewards and engagement. "Hopefully, players will understand that we'll react quickly if they feel we're not doing enough. We hear the community's feedback loud and clear."</p>
            <p>As for the most recent example, Hazzikostas pointed out that the developers didn't consider the impact of their own release cadence on the 20th anniversary event. The event started just eight weeks after The War Within released, meaning many players were still in a loop of ending the game. "Even if they really liked the 20th anniversary content, they felt like, 'I've spent a lot of time doing dungeons and depths and leveling a lot.'</p>
            <p>Adding 20th anniversary content on top of the existing 11.0 "chores" became overwhelming, which led to WoW increasing the bronze celebration tokens earned from the first season of the event.</p>
