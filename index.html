        <h2 class="section-title">How to Play the Memory Training Game</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The game consists of 20 levels, each one progressively harder than the last. Here’s how to play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the beginning of each level, a number sequence will be displayed on the screen for 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>You need to remember the sequence of numbers before it disappears.</li>
                <li>Once the numbers are hidden, you will have a few seconds to input the sequence exactly as shown.</li>
                <li>If you enter the correct sequence, you will move on to the next level. If you make a mistake, you can try again, but your score will be affected.</li>
                <li>Each level has a time limit, and the sequence length increases with every level. The higher the level, the harder the game becomes!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Scoring System</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Your performance in the game is scored based on how well you remember and input the number sequences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level 1: 5 points</li>
                <li>Level 2: 10 points</li>
                <li>Level 3: 15 points</li>
                <li>... and so on, increasing by 5 points for each level.</li>
                <li>The maximum score you can achieve is 1050 points by completing all 20 levels correctly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you score more than 840 points, you are considered to have an excellent memory! The higher your score, the better your recall ability is.</p>
