            <h2>Game: Ambition (Early Access)</h2>
            
            <h3>Content and Locations</h3>
            <p>This is a third-person business tycoon game where you will open businesses in a large area of New York City. The game is in early access.</p>

            <h3>What will you do?</h3>
            <p>In a third-person isometric perspective, you can choose the location to open and run a business, ranging from various retail stores to different office businesses.</p>

            <h3>Hunger, energy and happiness</h3>
            <p>Hunger, energy, and happiness are optional survival mechanisms. There are several ways to travel around the city: walking, driving, taxi, and subway.</p>

            <h3>Setting Up Your Business</h3>
            <p>After choosing the type of store and the location of the store, you need to go to the commercial furniture store to buy items such as cash registers, product fixtures, decorations, security products, speakers (for in-store music), etc. Arrange these items in the store to your liking and modify the walls and floors to make it more attractive. Now you can go to the recruitment service agency to recruit employees, or use the company's headhunter (if you have one).</p>

            <h3>Working in the Store</h3>
            <p>While the employees are being trained, you can set up your own supply chain. Choose where to buy goods from and set up orders. If you have a warehouse, they will ship your orders there, and your logistics specialists and delivery drivers will make sure the products get to the store (you have to decide how many of each product you want).</p>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of the game is simple: accumulate wealth and become the business/real estate king of New York.</p>

            <h3>Businesses You Can Run</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Liquor store</li>
                <li>Gift shop</li>
                <li>Clothing store</li>
                <li>Flower shop</li>
                <li>Jewelry store</li>
                <li>Fast food restaurant (all kinds)</li>
                <li>Coffee shop</li>
                <li>Supermarket</li>
                <li>Hair salon</li>
                <li>Night club</li>
                <li>Law firm</li>
                <li>Web development company</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New business types are added with each update.</p>

            <h3>The Good and the Bad</h3>
            <p>The game runs very well. Occasionally there are some bugs after an update, but they are quickly fixed.</p>

            <p>Great idea to write a theme! I am usually too lazy to write reviews, but I like to read other people's opinions. Sometimes I want to write a review, but most of the time I have never had any talent for expressing my thoughts, experiences, and feelings.</p>
